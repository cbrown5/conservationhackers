Conservation hackers is helping conserve nature by training scientists. We are making data science more accessible to conservation scientists and practitioners.  We are showing how scientists to have impact in the work they do.

[In our vlog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSH4ctGD-waPSI_4w6PlTBg/featured) we are making the connection between science and real world impact on the conservation of ecosystems. Dr Chris Brown interviews conservation scientists to get the news behind the research papers and find out how they are translating science into benefits for the environment. Chris also provides tips for conservation scientists.

Data science skills are powerful conservation tools, they can help us map and better understand ecosystems and people's interactions with nature. But data science requires quantitative skills in computer programming that can be daunting to learn. We are helping to overcome this barrier by training conservation scientists in data science.

For some people there just isn't the time to learn analytical skills for themselves, they might have bigger issues to deal with. That's why we also help connect conservation practitioners with the data scientists that can solve their analysis issues.
